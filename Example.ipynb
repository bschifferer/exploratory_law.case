       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "Michael Ratliff-El filed a complaint for mandamus relief (735 ILCS 5/14 — 101 et seq. (West 2000)) naming Kenneth R. Briley, warden of the Stateville Correctional Center, as the defendant. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss under section 2 — 615 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2 — 615 (West 2000)). On appeal, Ratliff-El argues that the trial court erred by dismissing his complaint because it stated a cause of action for mandamus relief. We affirm.\n",
       "BACKGROUND\n",
       "Ratliff-El is a prisoner at Stateville. In his complaint, Ratliff-El contended that the defendant had a clear duty to follow the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act (Act) (5 ILCS 100/1 — 1 et seq. (West 2000)) during adjustment committee and grievance proceedings at Stateville. As a result of such proceedings, Ratliff-El had been disciplined with revocation of good-time credits. Ratliff-El submitted that he was entitled to mandamus relief because the defendant had failed to follow Act procedures. He also alleged that the defendant’s failure to follow Act procedures violated his “rights.”\n",
       "The defendant filed a section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss Ratliff-El’s mandamus complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In his motion to dismiss, the defendant argued that the Act does not apply to adjustment committee and grievance proceedings conducted by the Department of Corrections (DOC). The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss and Ratliff-El appealed.\n",
       "ANALYSIS\n",
       "Motion to Dismiss Mandamus Action\n",
       "A. DOC Duty to Follow Act Procedures\n",
       "Ratliff-El argues that a state agency must follow Act procedures in “contested cases.” He reasons that because the DOC is a state agency, and adjustment committee and grievance proceedings meet the statutory definition of “contested cases,” the defendant has a clear duty to follow Act procedures in DOC adjustment committee and grievance proceedings. He contends that the trial court erred in granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss his mandamus cause of action.\n",
       "The defendant asserts that the Act contains a “grandfathering” clause (5 ILCS 100/1 — 5(a) (West 2000)) which exempts a state agency from using Act procedures when the agency had adjudicatory hearing rules in place on July 1, 1977. The defendant contends that the DOC had such adjudicatory hearing rules in place prior to July 1, 1977. The defendant submits that because the Act does not apply to DOC adjustment committee and grievance proceedings, the defendant has no duty to follow Act procedures. The defendant concludes, therefore, that Ratliff-El did not state a cause of action for mandamus relief. We agree with the defendant.\n",
       "A section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss attacks the legal sufficiency of a complaint and presents the issue of whether the complaint states a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. 735 ILCS 5/2 — 615 (West 2000); Weiss v. Waterhouse Securities, Inc., 335 Ill. App. 3d 875, 781 N.E.2d 1105 (2002). The standard of review for granting a section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss is de novo. Krilich v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 334 Ill. App. 3d 563, 778 N.E.2d 1153 (2002).\n",
       "A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that may be used only to compel a public official to perform a nondiscretionary ministerial duty. Caruth v. Quinley, 333 Ill. App. 3d 94, 775 N.E.2d 224 (2002). A complaint seeking a writ of mandamus must allege facts that establish (1) a clear right to the relief requested; (2) a clear duty of the defendant to act; and (3) the clear authority of the defendant to comply with the writ. Southern & Central Illinois Laborers’ District Council v. Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board, 331 Ill. App. 3d 1112, 772 N.E.2d 980 (2002).\n",
       "Section 1 — 5(a) of the Act states as follows:\n",
       "“[The Act] applies to every agency as defined in [this act]. Beginning January 1, 1978, in case of conflict between the provisions of [the Act] and the Act creating or conferring power on an agency, [this act] shall control. If, however, an agency *** has existing procedures on July 1, 1977, specifically for contested cases ***, those existing provisions control, except that this exception respecting contested cases *** does not apply if the Act creating or conferring power on the agency adopts by express reference the provisions of [this act]. Where the Act creating or conferring power on an agency establishes administrative procedures not covered by [this act], those procedures shall remain in effect.” 5 ILCS 100/1— 5(a) (West 2000).\n",
       "It is uncontested that (1) the DOC is an “agency,” and (2) adjustment committee and grievance proceedings are “contested cases,” as defined by the Act. See 5 ILCS 100/1 — 20, 1 — 30 (West 2000). The DOC had procedures in place on July 1, 1977, specifically for “contested cases.” See, e.g., Adm. Reg., Department of Corrections § 804, at 2 (eff. June 18, 1976) (concerning adjustment committee hearing procedures). These DOC procedures continue to be in place under the Illinois Administrative Code. See 20 111. Adm. Code § 504.80 (2003).\n",
       "The Unified Code of Corrections (Code) (730 ILCS 5/1 — 1—1 et seq. (West 2000)) is the Act that confers power on the DOC. 730 ILCS 5/3 — 2—2 (West 2000). The Code has not adopted the provisions of the Act by express reference. Furthermore, the Code established administrative procedures for the DOC, not covered by the Act, before July 1, 1977. See, e.g., Pub. Act 77 — 2097, eff. January 1, 1973 (creating, inter alia, disciplinary and grievance procedures). These procedures now are under sections 3 — 8—7 and 3 — 8—8 of the Code. 730 ILCS 5/3— 8 — 7, 3 — 8—8 (West 2000).\n",
       "Under section 1 — 5(a) of the Act, DOC adjustment committee and grievance procedures are not controlled by the Act. Because the defendant did not have a duty to follow Act procedures, Ratliff-El’s complaint did not state a cause of action for mandamus relief.\n",
       "B. Due Process\n",
       "Ratliff-El contends that he is entitled to mandamus relief because the defendant violated his due process rights by failing to follow Act procedures.\n",
       "Mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel the DOC to conduct disciplinary hearings consistent with due process. Thompson v. Lane, 194 Ill. App. 3d 855, 551 N.E.2d 731 (1990).\n",
       "In this case, we determined that the DOC does not have a duty to conduct disciplinary hearings under Act procedures. The defendant did not violate the plaintiffs due process rights by failing to follow Act procedures.\n",
       "Ratliff-El was not entitled to mandamus relief based on either (1) the defendant’s failure to follow Act procedures or (2) a violation of his due process rights. Therefore, the trial court did not err as a matter of law by granting the defendant’s section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss.\n",
       "CONCLUSION\n",
       "For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Will County circuit court granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss Ratliff-El’s mandamus action.\n",
       "Affirmed.\n",
       "SCHMIDT and LYTTON, JJ., concur. JUSTICE MAAG\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "The plaintiffs, Amanda and Brittany Adams, by their father and next friend, Tommy Adams, and Tommy Adams, individually, filed this cause of action against the defendant, Harrah’s Casino of Maryland Heights, Missouri, to recover damages for alleged personal injuries to the minor plaintiffs, Amanda and Brittany, arising out of an incident on the defendant’s premises. The defendant filed a special and limited entry of appearance claiming that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over it. On February 4, 2002, the circuit court denied the defendant’s motion and the defendant’s motion for reconsideration, and the court certified the following questions for interlocutory review pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 308(a) (155 Ill. 2d R. 308(a)): Can the circuit court properly exercise personal jurisdiction in a tort action over the defendant under the Illinois long-arm statute (735 ILCS 5/2 — 209 (West 1998)), and if so, can such exercise of personal jurisdiction satisfy the requirements for due process? We answer yes to the certified questions and remand this case for further proceedings.\n",
       "Subsequent to the February 4, 2002, order, the circuit court entered an ex parte amended order on February 15, 2002, that was never agreed to by the plaintiffs’ counsel and included more facts than the original certified questions. For these reasons, we will only consider the original certified questions and the facts contained within the record on appeal. We note parenthetically that the additional facts in the amended certified questions would have made no difference because those facts are contained within the record on appeal.\n",
       "Generally, an appeal under Rule 308 is limited to the question that is identified by the circuit court. Johnson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 323 Ill. App. 3d 376, 379, 752 N.E.2d 449, 452 (2001). When the circuit court has not heard testimony, the standard of review for a permissive interlocutory appeal of a certified question is de novo (El-Amin v. Dempsey, 329 Ill. App. 3d 800, 802, 768 N.E.2d 344, 346 (2002)). See Gaidar v. Tippecanoe Distribution Service, Inc., 299 Ill. App. 3d 1034, 1039-40, 702 N.E.2d 316, 319 (1998).\n",
       "Initially, the plaintiff carries the burden of establishing a prima facie basis upon which jurisdiction over nonresidents can be exercised. International Business Machines Corp. v. Martin Property & Casualty Insurance Agency, Inc., 281 Ill. App. 3d 854, 857-58, 666 N.E.2d 866, 868 (1996). Once the plaintiff demonstrates the requisite minimum contacts to establish personal jurisdiction, the defendant bears the burden of showing why the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant would be unreasonable. Worldtronics International, Inc. v. Ever Splendor Enterprise Co., 969 F. Supp. 1136, 1142 (N.D. Ill. 1997).\n",
       "The Illinois long-arm statute allows Illinois courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. 735 ILCS 5/2— 209(a), (b), (c) (West 1998). Although, at one time, subsection (a) of the long-arm statute listed the only acts that could form the basis for personal jurisdiction, subsection (c) was added in a 1989 amendment and is a catchall provision. Subsection (c) states as follows: “(c) A court may also exercise jurisdiction on any other basis now or hereafter permitted by the Illinois Constitution and the Constitution of the United States.” 735 ILCS 5/2 — 209(c) (West 1998). Illinois courts have treated section 2 — 209(c) as an independent basis for asserting in personam jurisdiction over a defendant. Flint v. Court Appointed Special Advocates of Du Page County, Inc., 285 Ill. App. 3d 152, 165, 674 N.E.2d 831, 841 (1996); Allerion, Inc. v. Nueva Icacos, S.A. de C.V., 283 Ill. App. 3d 40, 47, 669 N.E.2d 1158, 1163 (1996). Thus, an Illinois court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant as long as the exercise of such jurisdiction offends neither federal nor state guarantees of due process. 735 ILCS 5/2 — 209(c) (West 1998).\n",
       "Federal due process requires that, in order for a court to exercise in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, it is necessary that the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit there does not offend “ ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 90 L. Ed. 95, 102, 66 S. Ct. 154, 158 (1945), quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463, 85 L. Ed. 278, 283, 61 S. Ct. 339, 343 (1940). Those minimum contacts must have a basis in “ ‘some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.’ ” Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, 480 U.S. 102, 109, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92, 102, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 1030 (1987), quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 475, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528, 542, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 2183 (1985). This requirement ensures that an alien defendant will not be forced to litigate in a distant or inconvenient forum solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts or the unilateral act of a consumer or some other third person. Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 475, 85 L. Ed. 2d at 542, 105 S. Ct. at 2183. A court conducting a federal due process analysis must consider whether (1) the nonresident defendant had minimum contacts with the forum state such that there was fair warning that the nonresident defendant may be hailed into a forum court, (2) the action arose out of or related to the defendant’s contacts with the forum state, and (3) it is reasonable to require the defendant to litigate in the forum state. Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 471-77, 85 L. Ed. 2d at 540-44, 105 S. Ct. at 2181-84.\n",
       "The minimum-contacts and fair-warning requirements are satisfied if the defendant has purposefully directed its activities at Illinois residents, reached out beyond one state to create continuing relationships with citizens of another state, or purposefully derived benefits from its activities within the forum state. Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 471-74, 85 L. Ed. 2d at 540-41, 105 S. Ct. at 2181-83.\n",
       "In the instant case, the plaintiffs showed that the defendant maintains a significant customer base from Illinois. In fact, 63,596 of the defendant’s gold card holders are from Illinois. This is approximately one-third of all of the defendant’s gold card holders. Additionally, the defendant has directed advertisements, flyers, brochures, and coupons to Illinois residents. The record also shows that the defendant actively advertises in magazines, newspapers, television, radio, and the yellow pages where Illinois residents will be lured by those advertisements. Finally, the defendant advertises a free shuttle service from the Alton, Illinois, area. The free shuttle service requires no reservations, but seating is limited. Hence, there is no question that the defendant purposefully directed its activities toward Illinois residents and has reached out to create continuing relationships with those residents. Because the defendant has directed its activities toward the Illinois marketplace and has derived an economic benefit as a result of those activities, the minimum-contacts and fair-warning requirements are satisfied.\n",
       "The meaning of the minimum-contacts standard depends upon whether the forum asserts specific jurisdiction or general jurisdiction. Specific jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit “arising out of or related to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 n.8, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404, 411 n.8, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 1872 n.8 (1984). General jurisdiction refers to suits neither arising out of nor related to the defendant’s contacts, and it is permitted only where the defendant has “continuous and systematic general business contacts” with the forum. Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A., 466 U.S. at 416, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 412, 104 S. Ct. at 1873.\n",
       "The case at bar does not arise directly out of the defendant’s contacts with Illinois. We conclude, however, that the defendant has maintained continuous and systematic business contacts with Illinois that support the assertion of general jurisdiction over it. Therefore, the defendant’s contacts with Illinois cannot be characterized as random, fortuitous, or attenuated. See Quaker Oats Co. v. Chelsea Industries, Inc., 496 F. Supp. 85, 88 (N.D. Ill. 1980) (the assertion of jurisdiction was allowed where alien corporations engaged in out-of-state activities that were sufficiently continuous and systematic to satisfy due process concerns; over a period of several years, the corporations sold substantial amounts of their products to customers located in Illinois and sent representatives to Illinois on several occasions to meet with customers).\n",
       "In light of the defendant’s substantial activities directed at the Illinois marketplace, the volume of Illinois customers, and the shuttle service from Illinois to Missouri, it is reasonable for Illinois courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction over the defendant. Asserting jurisdiction over the defendant does not violate federal due process requirements.\n",
       "We also find that asserting in personam jurisdiction over the defendant is permissible under the Illinois Constitution. Due process in Illinois requires as follows: “Jurisdiction is to be asserted only when it is fair, just, and reasonable to require a nonresident defendant to defend an action in Illinois, considering the quality and nature of the defendant’s acts which occur in Illinois or which affect interests located in Illinois.” Rollins v. Ellwood, 141 Ill. 2d 244, 275, 565 N.E.2d 1302, 1316 (1990).\n",
       "As we have already demonstrated, the defendant in the case at bar has engaged in economic activities that have a substantial effect upon the people of the State of Illinois. The record demonstrates that the defendant shuttles Illinois residents who are planning to gamble from Alton, Illinois, to its Missouri business. The defendant directs advertisements, flyers, brochures, and coupons to Illinois residents. The defendant advertises in magazines, newspapers, television, radio, and the yellow pages where Illinois residents will be urged to gamble. The record shows that the defendant’s efforts have been successful, because one-third of all gold card members are Illinois residents. In light of the defendant’s substantial connections with Illinois, it is “fair, just, and reasonable” for an Illinois court to assert in personam jurisdiction over it. See Alderson v. Southern Co., 321 Ill. App. 3d 832, 856-58, 747 N.E.2d 926, 946-48 (2001).\n",
       "In summary, the certified questions were as follows: Can the circuit court properly exercise personal jurisdiction in a tort action over the defendant under the Illinois long-arm statute (735 ILCS 5/2 — 209 (West 1998)), and if so, can such exercise of personal jurisdiction satisfy the requirements for due process? We answer these questions in the affirmative.\n",
       "Certified questions answered.\n",
       "CHAPMAN and GOLDENHERSH, JJ., concur. PRESIDING JUSTICE HOPKINS\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "The petitioner, Alisha Bowlby, appeals the trial court’s judgment dissolving her marriage with the respondent, William Matthew Bowlby (Matthew). On appeal, Alisha asserts that the trial court erred because it failed to award growing crops to either party and because it denied Alisha’s pretrial motion to bar evidence concerning Matthew’s debt to his father, Robert Bowlby. Alisha also contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it divided the marital assets, awarded child support, and denied Alisha’s petition for attorney fees. We affirm as modified.\n",
       "FACTS\n",
       "Alisha and Matthew were married on August 1, 1992, and resided together for eight years until Alisha moved from the marital residence on August 15, 2000, and filed for a dissolution of their marriage on August 18, 2000. Two children were born from the parties’ union. At the time of the judgment, Alisha was 26 years old and Matthew was 28 years old.\n",
       "During the parties’ marriage, Matthew worked as a farmer, and during the summer of 1995, Matthew also worked at Asplundh Tree Service. Matthew and Robert farm together, although they own separate farming entities. During most of the marriage, Alisha did not work outside of the home. In 1999 she periodically worked at Asplundh Tree Service. After May 2000, Alisha became a full-time groundsman at Asplundh Tree Service and received a gross income of $16,394.58 for the year.\n",
       "The parties’ adjusted gross incomes during their marriage, as revealed by their 1998, 1999, and 2000 tax returns, was $9,141, $13,284, and $12,195, respectively. In 1999 and 2000, the parties’ cash-rented or leased acreage increased from 700 acres to 1,175 acres, and the crops at the time of the judgment consisted of 400 acres of corn and 775 acres of beans. Grain sales of 1999 and 2000 crops in 2000 totaled $155,918, and government payments through various agricultural programs totaled $25,053. Deducting farm expenses of $167,849, the parties’ net profit for 2000 equaled $13,122. The parties stipulated to the following values for the parties’ marital assets:\n",
       "1993 Freightliner truck/tractor $13,500 to 14,000\n",
       "Kinze 2600 23-row planter $36,000 to 36,500\n",
       "John Deere soil conditioner $13,500 to 14,000\n",
       "John Deere field cultivator $11,000 to 12,000\n",
       "Farm King swing-away auger $ 2,550 to 2,750\n",
       "1999 GMC Yukon utility truck $20,400\n",
       "1995 Dodge Ram truck $10,300.\n",
       "At the hearing, Alisha offered into evidence statements prepared by Matthew to secure financing. In the statements, Matthew listed the value of the parties’ mobile home as $12,000 and $14,000, exceeding Matthew’s submitted value of $9,500. Alisha also introduced statements in which Matthew estimated the value of the parties’ grain bin as $15,000, even though Matthew’s submitted appraisal and depreciation schedule at the hearing indicated a value of $6,450. In the statements, Matthew also listed various farming equipment as collateral, which, as Matthew and Robert explained, Matthew did not own but listed as collateral with the permission of Robert, who owned the equipment.\n",
       "The record revealed the following marital debt:\n",
       "Old National Bank secured by GMC Yukon $21,766.56\n",
       "Old National Bank secured by field cultivator $12,305.57\n",
       "Fifth Third Bank secured by grain bin $ 9,989.15\n",
       "Fifth Third Bank farm operating loan $50,929.17\n",
       "[[Image here]]\n",
       "Alisha filed a pretrial motion to bar evidence of debt to Robert because Matthew had failed to properly comply with discovery. The trial court denied Alisha’s motion, and at the hearing, Robert explained that he prepays crop inputs for the following year, Matthew uses the fertilizers, seed, and chemicals, and Matthew repays Robert after harvesting the crop. Robert entered into evidence a handwritten list that indicated expenses for the fertilizer, seed, chemicals, and equipment repairs and that revealed that Matthew owed Robert $9,000 for 2000 crop expenses. Robert explained that he expects repayment by Matthew at the end of the 2001 harvest. Robert further testified that he loaned Matthew and Alisha $3,282.04 to redeem the Yukon truck that had been repossessed by the bank.\n",
       "Matthew resided in the parties’ marital residence, a mobile home located on Robert’s property. Although title remained in Matthew’s name, Robert paid the monthly payments to provide Matthew with better access to farming activity.\n",
       "Matthew paid approximately $4,000 for attorney fees and costs during a criminal proceeding and during the divorce proceeding.\n",
       "Prior to the hearing, Alisha filed a petition for the contribution of interim attorney fees on May 15, 2001, which the trial court denied on May 22, 2001. At the hearing, Alisha attempted to introduce an evidence deposition, revealing an operating-loan debt that Matthew did not disclose in discovery, and asserted that the deposition reflected a pattern of withholding discovery and supported her petition for attorney fees. The trial court denied Alisha’s request to introduce the deposition.\n",
       "During the hearing, the trial court rejected as unconvincing Alisha’s evidence concerning the equipment and values listed on the financial statements. In its judgment, the trial court awarded the custody of the two children to Alisha and ordered Matthew to pay $300 per month for child support. The court held that the 120 billable hours of Alisha’s counsel was unreasonable given the nature of the proceedings and the situation of the parties, and it denied Alisha’s request for attorney fees. The court awarded Alisha the 1995 Dodge Ram pickup truck, free of debt, and assigned Alisha all debts held in her name. The court awarded Matthew all personal property in his possession, all farming equipment, the mobile home, the Yukon truck, and the four-wheeler. The court assigned to Matthew his personal debt and the debt associated with the farm, the mobile home, and the Yukon truck.\n",
       "On November 2, 2001, Alisha filed her timely notice of appeal.\n",
       "ANALYSIS\n",
       "Division of Marital Assets\n",
       "Alisha argues that the trial court abused its discretion because its division of marital assets was unjust, failed to account for Matthew’s dissipation of assets, relied on Matthew’s inadmissible hearsay and self-serving, undocumented assertions, and failed to provide the parties with comparable opportunities for the future acquisition of capital assets and income. We disagree.\n",
       "A trial court’s distribution of marital property should not be reversed absent an abuse of the trial court’s discretion, i.e., where no reasonable person could adopt the trial court’s position. In re Marriage of Schmidt, 242 Ill. App. 3d 961, 966 (1993). The touchstone of the apportionment of marital property is whether the distribution is equitable in nature. In re Marriage of Schmidt, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 966. Section 503(d) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Act) provides that marital property shall be divided in “just proportions” considering all relevant factors. 750 ILCS 5/503(d) (West 2000). “Just proportions” does not mean equal amounts, and the trial court is not obligated to make specific findings as the reasons for its award. In re Marriage of Schmidt, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 966. We do not consider the fairness of the distribution of marital assets on a piecemeal basis but determine if the distribution as a whole is in just proportions. In re Marriage of Steele, 212 Ill. App. 3d 425, 432 (1991).\n",
       "The trial court awarded the following:\n",
       "[[Image here]]\n",
       "[[Image here]]\n",
       "Alisha asserts that the total value of Matthew’s assets was greater than indicated because it included farm equipment that Matthew undervalued or denied owning. Credibility is an issue for the trial court (Chicago Investment Corp. v. Dolins, 107 Ill. 2d 120 (1985)), and the trial court did not err in relying on Matthew’s purported values, in rejecting Alisha’s purported -values, or in determining that Matthew listed as collateral farm equipment owned solely by Robert.\n",
       "Assuming Matthew dissipated assets in the asserted value of $4,000 (his attorney fees), the trial court allocated Matthew great liability in comparison to Alisha. We do not consider the fairness of the distribution of marital assets on a piecemeal basis but determine if the distribution as a whole is in just proportions. In re Marriage of Steele, 212 Ill. App. 3d at 432. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to allocate additional funds to Alisha for Matthew’s dissipation of assets. See Head v. Head, 168 Ill. App. 3d 697, 702-03 (1988).\n",
       "Even if we were to accept Alisha’s asserted personal debts of $18,600, $3,600 of which Alisha claimed as the use of her father’s truck, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in distributing the marital property, and Alisha’s arguments are unavailing. The trial court’s award was in “just proportions.” See 750 ILCS 5/503(d) (West 2000).\n",
       "Growing Crops\n",
       "Alisha argues that the trial court erred in failing to award to either party 1,175 acres of the 2001 growing crops. Alisha calculates the crops at a net value, after expenses, of $124,394.23, and Alisha requests this court to award her half of that value. We decline to do so.\n",
       "Future income is a marital asset where the income derives from efforts or products produced during the marriage. In re Marriage of Heinze, 257 Ill. App. 3d 782, 785 (1994). Crops grown even on non-marital property can be considered in determining marital income and marital property. In re Marriage of Mohr, 260 Ill. App. 3d 98, 103 (1994). Farm income derives from the sale of crops, and the labor may precede the income by many months. In re Marriage of Mohr, 260 Ill. App. 3d at 104. In farming, the income — the yield and the price — is uncertain and beyond control. In re Marriage of Mohr, 260 Ill. App. 3d at 104.\n",
       "The future income from the growing crops derived from Matthew’s efforts during the marriage is marital property. In its judgment, the trial court did not allocate the future income of the growing crops. However, the trial court allocated the considerable farming debt to Matthew, including the debt incurred to produce the crops, and Matthew will incur the debt to harvest the crops.\n",
       "The value of the growing crops is speculative, as is the farming business. Alisha values the crops at $124,394.23 and argues that awarding the entire future income from the growing crops to Matthew results in a greatly disproportionate award. However, Alisha’s purported value ignores the previous year’s crop income of $13,122 and is therefore untenable. Further, even if Alisha’s purported value was accepted and added entirely to Matthew’s distribution award in the judgment, Matthew’s net income after distribution remains in the negative while Alisha’s remains in the positive. After Matthew is awarded the entirety of the 2001 growing crop, the distribution remains equitable in nature and in just proportions. See 750 ILCS 5/503(d) (West 2000). Pursuant to our powers under Supreme Court Rule 366(a) (155 Ill. 2d R. 366(a)), we modify the trial court’s order and award the future income from the 2001 growing crops to Matthew. See In re Marriage of Smith, 122 Ill. App. 3d 213, 216 (1984) (farm debts and assets should remain in one person).\n",
       "Matthew’s Debt to Robert\n",
       "Alisha next argues that Matthew’s persistent refusal to produce explicit documentation concerning the debt owed to Robert deprived her of the opportunity to check the accuracy of the claim and that, therefore, the trial court erred when it allowed Robert to testify concerning the debt. We disagree.\n",
       "Under Supreme Court Rule 219(c) (166 Ill. 2d R. 219(c)), a trial court may bar testimony or other evidence if one party unreasonably refuses to comply with the relevant discovery rules, so long as the sanction imposed is just. Shelbyville Mutual Insurance Co. v. Sunbeam Leisure Products Co., 262 Ill. App. 3d 636, 641 (1994). “The decision of whether to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 219(c) [citation] and, if so, the type of sanction[ ] is largely within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that decision will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Shelbyville Mutual Insurance Co., 262 Ill. App. 3d at 641.\n",
       "Alisha filed a pretrial motion to bar evidence of Matthew’s debt to Robert on the basis of Matthew’s discovery abuses. The trial court denied the motion, and at the hearing, Robert testified that Matthew owed him $9,000 for 2000 crop expenses, and Robert provided a handwritten list of items he had supplied to Matthew, along with quantities and values. Contrary to Alisha’s assertion, the record reveals that Matthew did not act contumaciously in failing to disclose evidence prior to the hearing, and the trial court’s refusal to bar the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.\n",
       "Child Support\n",
       "Alisha asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding child support because it failed to account for Matthew’s parents’ assistance, Matthew’s standard of living, and Matthew’s earning potential. We disagree.\n",
       "The trial court may order a supporting parent to pay child support in an amount that is reasonable and necessary for the child’s well-being. 750 ILCS 5/505(a) (West 2000). The award of child support lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be set aside absent an abuse of that discretion, i.e., where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court. In re Marriage of Partney, 212 Ill. App. 3d 586, 590 (1991). The factors to be considered in exercising that discretion are set forth in section 505(a)(2) of the Act. 750 ILCS 5/505(a)(2) (West 2000). Generally, the Act guides the trial court to award 25% of the supporting party’s net income to support two children. 750 ILCS 5/505(a)(l) (West 2000). When the supporting parent’s income fluctuates, the court may reasonably average income for the previous three years to determine child support. In re Marriage of Nelson, 297 Ill. App. 3d 651, 655 (1998) (trial court properly averaged three years of farmer’s income to determine income for purposes of child support).\n",
       "In this case, the trial court had wide discretion to ensure that the needs of the minor children were met, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding child support payments of $300 per month. The parties’ joint tax returns for 1998, 1999, and 2000 revealed yearly total incomes of $9,141, $13,284, and $12,195, respectively. The average income for the three years was $11,540 per year, or $961.67 per month, 25% of which equaled a child support payment of $240.42. The trial court was within its discretion in awarding child support payments of $300 per month.\n",
       "Citing In re Marriage of Sweet, 316 Ill. App. 3d 101 (2000), Alisha contends that Matthew’s choice to farm, earning less than $15,000 per year, should not be at the expense of the parties’ children. Alisha asserts that because Matthew worked for Asplundh Tree Service for three months in the summer of 1995 and because his health allows him to custom combine or custom spray for pay, he should be charged with greater income for purposes of child support.\n",
       "In In re Marriage of Sweet, the trial court increased the respondent’s child support obligation, noting that the respondent entered an enterprise producing little income and either misrepresented his income or willfully refused to support his children. In re Marriage of Sweet, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 107. The respondent became self-employed after the original dissolution proceedings, made less each year after the divorce, and did not act in good faith when making the career change. In re Marriage of Sweet, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 107.\n",
       "Unlike In re Marriage of Sweet, Matthew has supported his family by farming throughout the parties’ marriage, and no evidence suggests he acted in bad faith while continuing to farm. Matthew testified that he did not have the equipment to custom spray and custom combine, and we dismiss Alisha’s suggestion that because Matthew is in good health, he should pursue employment with Alisha’s employer to earn greater income.\n",
       "Citing In re Marriage of Heil, 233 Ill. App. 3d 888 (1992), Alisha asserts that Robert’s assistance, paying for Matthew’s mobile home, redeeming the Yukon truck, paying for a vacation to Las Vegas, and allowing the use of his equipment at no cost, should be considered to increase Matthew’s child support. We reject Alisha’s argument concerning the redemption of the Yukon truck and the use of equipment because the record reveals that Matthew’s father expects payment for these items, and the trial court awarded liability for these items to Matthew in its judgment.\n",
       "In In re Marriage of Heil, to determine income for child support purposes, the trial court considered benefits, including a hunting lodge and the payment of taxes and insurance for the hunting lodge, that the respondent received from his company. In re Marriage of Heil, 233 Ill. App. 3d at 892-93. Unlike In re Marriage of Heil, however, Matthew’s and Robert’s farming entities are separate so that the gifts, including the vacation to Las Vegas and payment for the mobile home, derived from Robert personally. Alisha fails to cite authority to support the proposition that gifts are to be considered when a court determines net income for child support purposes. See In re Marriage of Harmon, 210 Ill. App. 3d 92, 95 (1991).\n",
       "Attorney Fees\n",
       "Alisha argues that the vast majority of her attorney’s expenses were caused by Matthew’s lack of cooperation and that the trial court incorrectly restricted Alisha’s evidence on this issue. We disagree.\n",
       "Section 508 of the Act provides that the court, after considering the financial resources of the parties, may order either party to pay attorney fees. 750 ILCS 5/508 (West 2000). An award of attorney fees in a dissolution proceeding rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will reverse only for an abuse of discretion. In re Marriage of Hillebrand, 258 Ill. App. 3d 835, 841 (1994).\n",
       "To justify an award of attorney fees, the party seeking such an allowance must establish an inability to pay those fees and the ability of the other spouse to do so. In re Marriage of Uphoff, 80 Ill. App. 3d 145, 147-48 (1980). Allowing attorney fees is never automatic, nor is it mandated simply upon a showing that one spouse has a slightly greater ability to pay the fees. In re Marriage Uphoff, 80 Ill. App. 3d at 147. The trial court considers the circumstances of the judicial proceedings and the identity of the spouse who precipitated the need for the current legal fees. Roth v. Roth, 52 Ill. App. 3d 220, 228 (1977). The trial court also considers the nature of the controversy, the complexity of the issues, and the significance of the subject matter. Green v. Green, 41 Ill. App. 3d 154 (1976).\n",
       "In 2000, Alisha’s earned income was greater than Matthew’s, and Matthew’s financial circumstances were not so much better than Alisha’s that he should be required to pay Alisha’s attorney fees. Further, we agree with the trial court that the expenses incurred were unreasonable considering the nature of the proceedings and the limited monetary resources of the parties. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award Alisha payment for her attorney fees.\n",
       "CONCLUSION\n",
       "For the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the judgment of the circuit court of Jackson County.\n",

       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "C. Michael Witters and Diane Witters (plaintiffs), individually and derivatively on behalf of Midwest Transit, Inc. (MWT), a nonpublic corporation, filed a three-count complaint in the circuit court of Lawrence County against Hal D. Hicks and MWT. The complaint alleged that Hicks, a 50% shareholder, had breached his fiduciary duty to plaintiffs and had converted corporate assets for his own use. Plaintiffs sought statutory relief pursuant to section 12.56 of the Business Corporation Act of 1983 (Act) (805 ILCS 5/12.56 (West 1998)) and money damages. The circuit court of Lawrence County granted a partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and entered an order to dissolve MWT and to appoint a liquidating receiver for purposes of winding up and liquidating the business and affairs of the corporation. Hicks appeals this judgment pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules 307(a)(2) and (a)(3) (188 Ill. 2d. Rs. 307(a)(2), (a)(3)).\n",
       "The case is not new to this court. A number of interlocutory appeals have been filed that either are pending or have recently been decided. The early procedural history of the case was set forth in Witters v. Hicks, 335 Ill. App. 3d 435, 780 N.E.2d 713 (2002), a decision that we issued during the pendency of this appeal. That history will not be recounted here. The record in this case has grown since Hicks. The record on appeal now before us contains more than 5,900 pages of pleadings, responses, and orders and an additional 3,000 pages of transcripts from hearings on discovery issues, summary judgment motions, and discovery violations. For purposes of this appeal, we need not summarize all of that activity. We will set forth only the facts and the procedural history pertinent to the issues raised in this appeal.\n",
       "On January 21, 2000, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that Hicks, a director, officer, and shareholder of MWT, was engaged in illegal, oppressive, and fraudulent acts; that Hicks misapplied and wasted corporate assets; and that as a result of Hicks’s conduct, MWT suffered or was in danger of suffering irreparable harm and plaintiffs, as 50% shareholders of MWT, were deprived of their rights and financial interests. Plaintiffs requested money damages and a variety of remedies pursuant to section 12.56(b) of the Act (805 ILCS 5/12.56(b) (West 2000)). The requested relief included orders to remove Hicks as an officer and director of MWT, to enjoin Hicks from conducting any business that would endanger MWT’s assets, to appoint a custodian to manage the business of MWT, to order a corporate accounting, and to order a dissolution of the corporation if all other remedies were found to be inadequate.\n",
       "Early in the proceedings, the parties stipulated to the entry of a temporary restraining order to protect the status quo with respect to the solvency of MWT. According to the stipulated order, Hicks was prohibited from taking any funds or receivables of MWT for his own use. Subsequently, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction with similar prohibitions. On November 16, 2000, the court granted a motion for sanctions and struck Hicks’s pleadings, including his answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims, and entered a judgment against the defendants on all issues of liability because of numerous and repeated discovery violations. A hearing on the issue of the appropriate remedies and monetary sanctions was to be scheduled at a later date.\n",
       "On March 21, 2001, plaintiffs filed a motion for the appointment of a receiver to run the business of MWT. In the motion, plaintiffs alleged that MWT’s directors and shareholders were deadlocked, that Hicks had stolen money from the corporation, that Hicks failed to keep current and accurate financial corporate records, that Hicks had wasted or dissipated corporate assets and engaged in acts of self-dealing, and that this conduct caused irreparable harm to the corporation. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court entered an order appointing an interim receiver for MWT and waiving the receiver’s bond. In its order, entered July 25, 2001, the court found that the evidence established that the directors were deadlocked and that the deadlock threatened the management of corporate affairs and the ability of MWT to carry on its business. The court also found that the evidence established that Hicks had misapplied corporate assets and engaged in fraudulent, illegal, and oppressive acts. The court concluded that MWT’s business and existence were in “immediate jeopardy,” and the court appointed an interim receiver to run the business of MWT until the litigation was resolved. Don Hoagland was appointed as the interim receiver. The court also granted plaintiffs’ motion to waive bond for the receiver. Hicks appealed.\n",
       "1\n",
       "Pretrial proceedings continued while the case was on appeal. On October 26, 2001, plaintiffs filed a motion for a partial summary judgment asking the court to enter an order to dissolve the corporation pursuant , to section 12.56 of the Act and to appoint a liquidating receiver pursuant to section 12.60(e) of the Act (805 ILCS 5/12.60(e) (West 1998)). Following a hearing, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion. On February 22, 2002, the trial court ordered the dissolution of MWT and appointed Don Hoagland to serve as the liquidating receiver. On March 15, 2002, plaintiffs moved for a waiver of the receiver’s bond. After considering Hicks’s objections, the trial court granted the motion and waived the receiver’s bond. It is from these orders that Hicks now appeals.\n",
       "In his first point, Hicks contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order appointing a liquidating receiver while the order granting the interim receiver was on appeal. Hicks argues that the February 22, 2002, order is an impermissible modification of the order on appeal because it extends the authority and powers of the interim receiver.\n",
       "The appeal of an interlocutory order does not divest the trial court of all jurisdiction in a case. See Payne v. Coates-Miller, Inc., 68 Ill. App. 3d 601, 608, 386 N.E.2d 398, 403-04 (1979); Cygnar v. Martin-Trigona, 26 Ill. App. 3d 291, 293, 325 N.E.2d 76, 78 (1975). Rather, it restrains the trial court from entering any order that would change or modify the order on appeal or that would have the effect of interfering with the review of that order. See Payne, 68 Ill. App. 3d at 608, 386 N.E.2d at 403-04; see also Lind v. Spannuth, 8 Ill. App. 2d 442, 452, 131 N.E.2d 796, 802 (1956) (Feinberg, J., specially concurring). Orders entered after the filing of a notice of appeal are valid if the substantive issues in the interlocutory appeal are not altered so that they present a new case to the reviewing court. R.W. Dunteman Co. v. C/G Enterprises, Inc., 181 Ill. 2d 153, 162, 692 N.E.2d 306, 312 (1998).\n",
       "The trial court retains jurisdiction to hear and determine matters that arise independently of and are unrelated to that portion of the proceeding that is before the reviewing court. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the issues regarding the dissolution of MWT were independent of the order appointing an interim receiver.\n",
       "An interim receiver or custodian is appointed to manage the business and affairs of the corporation under the conditions and for the term established by the court. See 805 ILCS 5/12.56(b)(6), 12.60(h) (West 1996). The receiver’s duties include preserving the corporate assets and carrying on the business of the corporation until a full hearing can be held in regard to the shareholder’s action. Firebaugh v. McGovern, 404 Ill. 143, 150, 88 N.E.2d 473, 476 (1949). Generally, an interim receiver may be appointed if (1) the directors are managing or disposing of the corporate business or assets in such a manner to serve their own interests so that the assets will probably be lost or destroyed before a decision on the merits, (2) internal dissensions are deadlocking the corporation and frustrating or threatening its purpose or objectives, (3) the failure or refusal of directors to meet and transact business is jeopardizing the interests of the shareholders, or (4) other conditions of dissension, dispute, fraud, or mismanagement exist that make it impossible for the corporation to carry on its business or preserve its assets until a settlement is reached. Firebaugh, 404 Ill. at 149, 88 N.E.2d at 476.\n",
       "A liquidating receiver may be appointed once the court orders the dissolution of the corporation. 805 ILCS 5/12.60(e) (West 1998). A liquidating receiver is appointed to close up the affairs of a corporation or to effect its dissolution. Firebaugh, 404 Ill. at 150, 88 N.E.2d at 476. The powers and duties of the liquidating receiver are set forth in the order of appointment, but those duties may be revised by the court throughout the proceedings. 805 ILCS 5/12.60(e) (West 1998). The court may authorize the liquidating receiver to collect the assets of the corporation, to sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of assets of the corporation, and to wind up and liquidate the corporation’s business and affairs. 805 ILCS 5/12.60(e) (West 1998).\n",
       "The appointment of an interim receiver and the appointment of a liquidating receiver are different remedies. Each remedy has a specific purpose. The facts and circumstances in a particular case will determine which remedy applies. Though there may be some overlap in the evidence, the remedies are distinct.\n",
       "The propriety of the order appointing an interim receiver was at issue in Hicks. In that case, the issue was whether the evidence established that the appointment of an interim receiver was necessary to prevent the dissipation of the corporate assets or the destruction of the corporate business until the disputed issues could be resolved. A liquidating receiver is not appointed to preserve the assets and the business of corporation but to wind up its affairs and to liquidate its assets. Thus, the decision regarding the appointment of a liquidating receiver involves different considerations. Before a liquidating receiver can be appointed, the court must find that conditions of dissension, dispute, fraud, or mismanagement make it impossible for the corporation to continue to function and that a dissolution is the only adequate remedy. In our view, the judgment regarding the dissolution and liquidation did not modify the order appointing an interim receiver and did not interfere with the appellate review of that order. That appeal did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider and to rule on matters raised in the summary judgment motion.\n",
       "In his next point, Hicks contends that the trial court erred in appointing a liquidating receiver because there were legal remedies and less intrusive equitable remedies available to the trial court. Hicks notes that plaintiffs have prayed for money damages and argues that equitable remedies are not appropriate because there is an adequate legal remedy. Alternatively, Hicks argues that there were equitable remedies, less intrusive than a dissolution, available to the trial court, including a sale of stock to Hicks, a statutory election under section 12.56(f) of the Act (805 ILCS 5/12.56(f) (West 1998)), or a public sale of the company pursuant to section 12.56(b) of the Act. Hicks also argues that the evidence does not support the appointment of a liquidating receiver.\n",
       "In the order directing that MWT be dissolved, the trial court specifically stated that it had considered the financial condition of the company and all of the facts and the evidence presented during a number of hearings and found “that no remedy specified in subdivisions (1) [through] (11) of [section] 12.56(b), or any other alternative remedy, is sufficient to resolve the matters in dispute.” The court also noted that the facts established in the interim hearing had not changed and that recent filings “strengthened the case for a liquidating receivership.”\n",
       "According to section 12.56(b)(12) of the Act, the circuit court may order the dissolution of a corporation if it determines that the statutory remedies available in subdivisions (1) through (11) and other alternative remedies are insufficient to resolve the matters in dispute. 805 ILCS 5/12.56(b)(12) (West 1998). The record reveals that the trial court considered alternative remedies throughout the early stages of the litigation. The trial court explored, albeit unsuccessfully, an independent appraisal of the corporation, the sale of the corporation, and a buyout of one shareholder by the other. In addition, the court considered Hicks’s section 12.56(f) petition to purchase plaintiffs’ shares of stock but determined that it was untimely and therefore not available as a remedy. That determination was affirmed in Hicks. Hicks, 335 Ill. App. 3d at 445, 780 N.E.2d at 722.\n",
       "In this case, there is evidence that Hicks failed to produce some of the corporate records and had other records destroyed and that this activity occurred at a time when Hicks and the company were under the supervision of the court-appointed receiver. According to the record before us, no one has been able to make a true evaluation of the business or a fair assessment of the stock value. It does not appear that an accounting has been completed. Factors to be considered in determining the fair value of shares include the market price for the shares, the nature of the business and its history, the economic outlook of the business and the specific industry, and the book value and financial condition of the business. Taxy v. Worden, 181 Ill. App. 3d 97, 101-02, 536 N.E.2d 901, 904 (1989). The failure to preserve the corporate records evidences dishonesty in keeping a true, honest, and intelligible accounting of the corporate business. See generally Chicago Mutual Life Indemnity Ass’n v. Hunt, 127 Ill. 257, 286-87, 20 N.E. 55, 64 (1889). Such conduct subjects shareholders to constant uncertainty regarding the value of their investments and to a constant vulnerability to fraud. The evidence of the ongoing, oppression, coupled with evidence that the shareholders are deadlocked with respect to MWT’s business operations, supports a finding that alternative remedies are inadequate. See Gidwitz v. Lanzit Corrugated Box Co., 20 Ill. 2d 208, 220, 170 N.E.2d 131, 138 (1960). Based on this record, we cannot say that the trial court erred in entering an order of dissolution and appointing a liquidating receiver.\n",
       "In his third point, Hicks asserts that the trial court erred in waiving the bond for the liquidating receiver. Hicks points out that section 2 — 415(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2 — 415(a) (West 1992)) directs the party seeking the appointment of a receiver to give a bond and that the bond can only be waived by the court upon notice and a full hearing. Hicks contends that the court’s order is improper because on this waiver issue there was neither notice of a hearing nor a full hearing. Hicks also argues that there are few circumstances under which a bond can be waived and that those circumstances are not applicable to the facts of this case.\n",
       "Hicks correctly notes that there was no discussion of the receiver’s bond during the February 22, 2002, hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for a summary judgment on the dissolution and receiver issues. However, there was a hearing on the issue of a bond. According to the record, plaintiffs distributed a proposed order regarding the summary judgment during the February 22, 2002, hearing. The court did not enter the order at that time. In letters dated February 25, 2002, and March 12, 2002, Hicks notified the court of his objections to plaintiffs’ proposed order, including an objection to the bond-waiver provision. Hicks objected to the bond-waiver provision on the grounds that the issue had not been addressed during the February 22, 2002, hearing and that a noticed hearing had not been held on the issue. Hicks also argued that a bond was necessary to protect his financial interests. Thus, Hicks’s objections were filed with the court. Those objections were taken up during a hearing held on March 15, 2002. During that proceeding, Hicks had an opportunity to cross-examine the appointed receiver and to make arguments to the court. Hicks did not present any witnesses or offer other evidence in support of his position, though he had an opportunity to do so. The record clearly establishes that Hicks had notice and an opportunity to contest the bond-waiver issue.\n",
       "Following a hearing, the trial court determined that a bond was unnecessary. In its March 25, 2002, order, the court gave the following reasons for its decision:\n",
       "“[T]he Court further finds that bond is not necessary. The facts established in the interim hearing have not been altered or changed. Recent filings have, if anything, strengthened the case for a liquidating receivership. No danger is threatened to the company. The company, which was previously insolvent, is now making a profit. All asset sales in excess of $5,000.00 and all debt compromises are subject to prior court approval, and the liquidating receiver is to obtain prior court approval of this plan of dissolution.”\n",
       "The legislature has given the circuit court discretion to determine whether a bond should be required and, if so, in what amount. Section 2 — 415(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure states as follows:\n",
       "“§ 2 — 415. Appointment of and actions against receivers, (a) Before any receiver shall be appointed!,] the party making the application shall give bond to the adverse party in such penalty as the court may order and with security to be approved by the court conditioned to pay all damages including reasonable attorney’s fees sustained by reason of the appointment and acts of such receiver, in case the appointment of such receiver is revoked or set aside. Bond need not be required[ ] when[,] for good cause shown, and upon notice and full hearing, the court is of the opinion that a receiver ought to be appointed without such bond.” 735 ILCS 5/2— 415(a) (West 1998).\n",
       "Section 12.60(g) of the Act provides that a receiver “shall give such bond as the court may direct with such sureties as the court may require.” 805 ILCS 5/12.60(g) (West 1998).\n",
       "In this case, the testimony and the reports of the interim receiver indicate that the financial position of the corporation had improved since the appointment of the interim receiver. The record indicates that the receiver eliminated some of the debt, preserved the corporate assets, and kept the business in operation. There is no evidence indicating that the receiver was incompetent or would compromise the interests of the corporation or of Hicks. The trial court noted that Don Hoagland had become familiar with the corporation through his work as interim receiver. The court pointed out that he was familiar with the corporate obligations, the interests of the creditors and shareholders, and the value of the corporation as far as that could be judged given the problems resulting from missing records. The court placed tight restrictions on the receiver’s activities in winding up the business, required court approval for any transaction involving corporate assets and debts, and required court approval of any plan of dissolution.\n",
       "Where there is evidence to support an application for a bond waiver, the objector must present some evidence or argument to demonstrate that his interests will be jeopardized if a bond is not posted. Hicks has failed to make that showing. Nevertheless, the record in this case leads us to conclude that plaintiffs should post a reasonable bond to protect the interests of all parties in this case. Even without an accounting, it appears that substantial assets are at issue and that the parties and creditors have claimed interests in those. In addition to the complexities of liquidation, the path of the litigation and the nature of the proceedings demonstrate that a bond is required to protect all interests. We therefore remand the case to the circuit court to assess a reasonable bond to be posted by plaintiffs.\n",
       "In his final point, Hicks alleges that the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding plaintiffs’ ownership of stock and their standing to sue. Hicks claims that plaintiffs lacked standing to file suit because they acquired their stock without consideration and through a breach of a fiduciary duty.\n",
       "In Illinois, standing is an affirmative defense. Greer v. Illinois Housing Development Authority, 122 Ill. 2d 462, 494, 524 N.E.2d 561, 575 (1988). The defendant has the burden to plead and prove a lack of standing. Greer, 122 Ill. 2d at 494, 524 N.E.2d at 575. In this case, Hicks raised the issue of plaintiffs’ standing as an affirmative defense in his answer and in a motion to dismiss. However, the trial court struck all of Hicks’s pleadings and affirmative defenses and granted a judgment in favor of plaintiffs as sanctions for discovery violations. Upon the entry of the sanctions order, plaintiffs’ standing was not an issue. The point is without merit.\n",
       "Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court ordering the dissolution of MWT and appointing a liquidating receiver is affirmed, the order granting plaintiffs’ motion to waive the receiver’s bond is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court to assess a reasonable receiver’s bond to be posted by plaintiffs.\n",
       "Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.\n",
       "CHAPMAN and WELCH, JJ., concur.\n",
       "1 On September 4, 2002, we affirmed the order appointing the interim receiver. Witters v. Hicks, 335 Ill. App. 3d 435, 780 N.E.2d 713 (2002). After reviewing the record, we concluded that there was overwhelming evidence that Hicks had converted corporate assets for his own personal use, that Hicks had failed to properly account for income generated by a loan program in violation of generally accepted accounting principles, that Hicks had used MWT personnel to bid contracts for a competing business which he owned, and that Hicks’s conduct demonstrated a pattern of fraudulent and illegal activity. In our decision, we noted that the trial court had not given any reasons for waiving the receiver’s bond, and we remanded the case with directions to require the receiver to give a bond pursuant to section 12.60(g) of the Act (805 ILCS 5/12.60(g) (West 1998)). PRESIDING JUSTICE THEIS\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "Defendant, Blockbuster, Inc.\n",
       "1\n",
       ", appeals from an interlocutory order of the circuit court denying its motion to compel certain class action members to arbitrate their claims for relief from unlawful penalties, unjust enrichment, breach of implied contract, and breach of express contract. Blockbuster contends that (1) those class members who signed membership agreements after mid-August 2001 are bound to arbitrate their individual claims; (2) the cost of arbitration does not render the arbitration agreement invalid or preclude plaintiffs from vindicating their rights; and (3) the terms of the agreement barring class actions or class arbitration is not unconscionable.\n",
       "BACKGROUND\n",
       "On February 18, 1999, plaintiffs filed a class-action-styled complaint against Blockbuster alleging that it charged improper and excessive fees to its customers who returned videos untimely or failed to return them. Thereafter, the circuit court certified the class to include (1) all United States residents who rented videos from Blockbuster who incurred late fees between February 18, 1994, and the date this case is resolved; (2) all United States residents who rented videos from Blockbuster and were forced to purchase an unreturned video between February 18, 1994, and the date this case is resolved; and (3) all entities that have done or are doing business in the United States as Blockbuster at any time since February 18, 1994.\n",
       "Simultaneously, numerous other state court class action lawsuits were filed throughout the country asserting similar causes of action on behalf of Blockbuster customers. On April 11, 2001, Blockbuster entered into a nationwide settlement in the case of Scott v. Blockbuster, Inc., No. D 162 — 535 (Jefferson County, Texas) (Scott). The Scott settlement class was defined to include “[a]ll members of Blockbuster who incurred an extended viewing fee or non-return fee between January 1, 1992, and April 1, 2001.” The settlement was finally approved in January 2002. An appeal taken by some of plaintiffs’ class representatives remains pending in the Texas Appellate Court.\n",
       "On January 22, 2002, plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint. Therein, they acknowledged that unless the Scott settlement is reversed on appeal, the class will need to be redefined. The complaint additionally alleges that in approximately mid-August 2001, Blockbuster began using a new membership application form for new members. The membership application contains an arbitration agreement, which provides as follows:\n",
       "“To fairly resolve any dispute between you and Blockbuster regarding your membership, account, fees, any transaction with Blockbuster, or any Blockbuster policies, you and Blockbuster agree that any claims of these types by either you or Blockbuster shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for the resolution of consumer-related disputes, or under other mutually-agreed procedures. Because this method of dispute resolution is personal, individual, and provides the exclusive method for resolving such disputes, you further agree that you will not participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement.”\n",
       "Plaintiffs attached the revised membership agreement to their amended complaint. Plaintiffs additionally alleged that the representative plaintiffs of the class did not sign a membership agreement containing an arbitration provision. Thus, questions remain regarding the extent of the claims that would proceed in court. Plaintiffs maintained that they may assert the following claims on behalf of Blockbuster members: (1) all presettlement claims if Scott is reversed on appeal; (2) all presettlement claims of those members who opted out of the Scott settlement; (3) all postsettlement claims of members, including the representative class, who did not sign the August 2001 membership agreement; and (4) all postsettlement claims of members who signed the August 2001 membership agreement if it is found to be invalid and unenforceable.\n",
       "In response to the amended complaint, Blockbuster filed motions to dismiss pursuant to sections 2 — 615 and 2 — 619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) (735 ILCS 5/2 — 615, 2 — 619 (West 2000)). As part of its section 2 — 615 motion, Blockbuster argued, citing both the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (2000)) and the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/1 et seq. (West 2000)), that any claims that plaintiffs purported to bring on behalf of Blockbuster members who joined after mid-August 2001 were subject to arbitration and therefore could not be heard by the trial court. Plaintiffs replied that Blockbuster could not compel arbitration of absent class members because those members are not parties to the proceeding, the representatives of the class are not subject to the arbitration agreement, and factual issues existed that would preclude such a finding. Plaintiffs further argued that as to the absent class members who signed the new membership application, the arbitration provision was invalid and unenforceable. The arbitration issue was not addressed in Blockbuster’s section 2 — 619 motion to dismiss.\n",
       "Thereafter, on April 8, 2002, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions to dismiss but did not make a ruling at that time. The court directed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to address a matter of pleading and directed Blockbuster to amend its pending section 2 — 615 or section 2 — 619 motion to dismiss to further address the arbitration issue. On April 22, 2002, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint. Thereafter, Blockbuster filed a pleading styled “Supplemental Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for a Partial Stay and to Compel Arbitration,” incorporating its previous motions to dismiss and again arguing that those members who signed the revised membership agreement are precluded from litigating their claims before a trial court and must be compelled to arbitrate their individual claims.\n",
       "On September 4, 2002, the trial court addressed the section 2 — 615 and section 2 — 619 motions to dismiss. During the court’s oral ruling, it raised two concerns regarding the arbitration provision in the new membership agreement: (1) the impact of the arbitration fee on the decision of a member to arbitrate in light of the modicum of damages involved; and (2) whether precluding members from pursuing class action suits would be unconscionable. Ultimately, the trial judge stated, “I don’t wish to address this issue in this case at this stage because we’re here on a motion to dismiss.” He stated that he was expressing a “general concern with the arbitration provision here in light of the realities and money involved.” The order, as drafted by plaintiffs’ counsel and signed by the trial judge, stated in pertinent part that “defendant’s supplemental motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for a partial stay and to compel arbitration are denied for the reasons stated in open court.”\n",
       "On September 25, 2002, plaintiffs filed a motion to clarify the trial court order as to whether the court had in fact ruled on Blockbuster’s alternative motion for a partial stay and to compel arbitration. On October 1, 2002, Blockbuster filed a notice of appeal from the order of September 4, 2002, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (188 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1)), believing that the trial court had indeed denied its motion to compel arbitration. Thereafter, at the hearing on the motion to clarify on October 3, 2002, the trial judge commented:\n",
       "“THE COURT: What I had before me basically was the motion to dismiss. That is what I was dealing with at that time.\n",
       "THE COURT: Can you say in good faith that I denied the motion to compel arbitration?\n",
       "* * *\n",
       "THE COURT: I certainly know what the record reflects. I think I am saying very candidly that the provision that was drafted by [plaintiffs’ counsel] might be ambiguous. I read it differently.”\n",
       "The trial judge then reiterated his concerns that the cost of arbitration might preclude an effective remedy and his concerns that the agreement precluded a right to file a class action case. He then explained:\n",
       "“I said I wondered about that. I also made reference to an out of state case where they talked about this being contracted — and I said I am not there. I’m not making any rulings on that. I want the parties to know where my head is with regard to this. And that is what I said. That’s clearly what I think the record reflects. This order which was drafted by [plaintiffs’ counsel] maybe [sic] ambiguous. I read it and I thought I knew what it says. You say it says something else. That’s where I am at.”\n",
       "Ultimately, however, the court found that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion to clarify its ruling because Blockbuster had already filed its notice of appeal.\n",
       "ANALYSIS\n",
       "During the pendency of this appeal, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the circuit court had not ruled on Blockbuster’s alternative motion to compel arbitration, that it only ruled on the motions to dismiss, and that Supreme Court Rule 307 (188 Ill. 2d R. 307) does not allow an interlocutory appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss. Alternatively, plaintiffs argued that the •arbitration issue was not yet ripe for adjudication by the circuit court. They maintained that where no class representative signed an arbitration agreement, no person subject to the arbitration provision is presently before the court. In response, Blockbuster argued that the circuit court indeed ruled on the motion to compel arbitration because it refused to grant the requested relief and because it entered an order expressly denying the motion. On November 1, 2002, this court entered an order denying without explanation plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss.\n",
       "Plaintiffs again renewed the jurisdictional and ripeness arguments before this court in their appellees’ brief. A motion to dismiss made in a reviewing court is not unassailable and can be reconsidered. Dunn v. Patton, 307 Ill. App. 3d 375, 376-77, 718 N.E.2d 264, 266 (1999). We choose to revisit this issue. It is undisputed that a party may take an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration under Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1). 188 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1); Notaro v. Nor-Evan Corp., 98 Ill. 2d 268, 270-71, 456 N.E.2d 93, 94-95 (1983); Federal Signal Corp. v. SLC Technologies, Inc., 318 Ill. App. 3d 1101, 1105, 743 N.E.2d 1066, 1070 (2001). Based upon the four corners of the trial court order, it appears that the court denied the motion to compel arbitration. Where the language of the order appealed from is clear and unambiguous, it generally is not subject to construction and cannot be controlled by an alleged intent or purpose not expressed therein. Comdisco, Inc. v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 285 Ill. App. 3d 796, 799, 674 N.E.2d 902, 904 (1996).\n",
       "However, substance, not form, determines whether a matter has been adjudicated by the trial court for purposes of determining whether an appeal is proper. In re Marriage of Lehr, 317 Ill. App. 3d 853, 858, 740 N.E.2d 417, 421 (2000). The written order of September 4, 2002, also expressly states that it is entered “for the reasons stated in open court.” In construing the order in conjunction with the trial transcript of proceedings, it is evident that there exists ambiguity as to whether the trial court ruled on the motion to compel arbitration or whether it limited its ruling to the motions to dismiss. Thus, where there is ambiguity, we look to the transcript of proceedings to determine the trial court’s intent. Twardowski v. Holiday Hospitality Franchising, Inc., 321 Ill. App. 3d 509, 512, 748 N.E.2d 222, 226 (2001). Here, the trial judge specifically stated that he was only ruling on the motions to dismiss, that he did not make any ruling on the arbitration issue, but merely wanted the parties to know his initial concerns. Accordingly, we find that the interlocutory appeal is premature and that we lack jurisdiction in this matter.\n",
       "Blockbuster cites various federal court cases applying the Federal Arbitration Act. These cases stand for the proposition that section 16(a) (9 U.S.C. § 16(a) (2000)) allows for an immediate appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration despite a court’s desire for further discovery or desire to revisit the issue before conclusively ruling on the motion as a final order. See Boomer v. AT&T Corp., 309 F.3d 404 (7th Cir. 2002); Koveleskie v. SBC Capital Markets, Inc., 167 F.3d 361 (7th Cir. 1999); Sandvik AB v. Advent International Corp., 220 F.3d 99 (3rd Cir. 2000). This court is not bound by federal procedural law and Blockbuster fails to cite any authority to suggest that federal law controls the appealability of a state court order, denying a motion to compel arbitration. See Comdisco, 285 Ill. App. 3d at 801, 674 N.E.2d at 905 (state procedural law remains applicable to state court proceeding). Furthermore, we find these cases distinguishable where there was no doubt from the record in these cases that the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration. Here, the order is ambiguous and when construed with the transcript of proceedings clearly evidences that the court did not rule on the issue of arbitrability but, rather, ruled on the motions to dismiss, which were not immediately appealable.\n",
       "Nevertheless, even if the trial court’s order were to be interpreted as a denial of the motion to compel and we considered the merits of the appeal, the sole issue before this court for review would be whether there was a showing sufficient to sustain the order of the trial court denying the motion to compel arbitration. Lundy v. Farmers Group, Inc., 322 Ill. App. 3d 214, 218, 750 N.E.2d 314, 318 (2001). Initially, we consider the procedural mechanism by which a trial court grants or denies a motion to compel arbitration in Illinois state court. Section 2 of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/2 (West 2000)) addresses those procedures and provides in pertinent part:\n",
       "“(a) On application of a party showing an agreement *** and the opposing party’s refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration, but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of the issue so raised and shall order arbitration if found for the moving party, otherwise, the application shall be denied.” (Emphasis added.) 710 ILCS 5/2(a) (West 2000).\n",
       "Thus, where a party denies the existence of the arbitration agreement, the Act contemplates a substantive disposition of the issues presented to the court. Comdisco, 285 Ill. App. 3d at 800-01, 674 N.E.2d at 904-05.\n",
       "Here, plaintiffs denied the existence of the arbitration agreement. They claimed that it was void and unenforceable because the arbitration forum imposes prohibitively high costs on its members, thereby rendering the forum an illusory remedy, and argued that the provision barring class actions was unconscionable. Additionally, they argued that the issue of arbitrability was not ripe for adjudication where the class representatives are not subject to the arbitration agreement. This, in turn, raises questions regarding whether the court could bind absent class members without notice and an opportunity to opt out of the class, and whether class representatives can adequately represent the absent class members’ interests. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 811-12, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 641-42, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 2974 (1985).\n",
       "Even if we were to consider the trial court’s order as a denial of the motion to compel arbitration, the trial court did not comply with the statutory mandate where the record reflects that it made no substantive rulings on the issues raised by plaintiffs below regarding the validity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement. There are several factual and legal issues that need to be resolved before a determination on arbitrability can be resolved. Some of those issues include defining the class and addressing whether the representative parties who have not signed arbitration agreements can adequately represent the class where their interests may be divergent and they cannot be compelled to arbitrate. Additional questions remain regarding what law governs the validity of the arbitration agreement where there is a national class, possible minimal contacts with the forum state, and issues of contract construction. Where the trial judge merely raised factual and legal issues of concern, but failed to make a substantive determination of the issues raised, we find that there was not a showing sufficient to sustain the denial of the motion.\n",
       "In rendering our decision, we find the case of Comdisco, 285 Ill. App. 3d 796, 674 N.E.2d 902, to be instructive. There, the defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiffs opposed it on the ground that the agreement to arbitrate was invalid, having alleged in its complaint fraudulent inducement and having sought a stay of arbitration until the court determined which issues were arbitrable. Following argument on the matter, the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration merely based upon the allegations in the complaint. Comdisco, 285 Ill. App. 3d at 797-98, 674 N.E.2d at 902-04.\n",
       "The appellate court held that the trial court erred in denying the motion to compel without ruling on the arbitrability of the dispute. The court relied upon section 2(a) of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/2(a) (West 2000)), holding that the Act contemplated a substantive disposition of a motion to compel arbitration and, absent such a ruling, there was not a showing sufficient to sustain the denial of the motion. The court reversed and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with section 2(a) of the Act. Comdisco, 285 Ill. App. 3d at 800-01, 674 N.E.2d at 904-05.\n",
       "Similarly, here, it is evident from the record that the trial court made no substantive rulings regarding the validity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement and, absent such a ruling, we cannot say there was a sufficient showing to sustain the denial of the motion to compel arbitration as mandated by section 2(a) of the Uniform Arbitration Act. 710 ILCS 5/2(a) (West 2000). Thus, whether we construe the trial court’s order as merely a denial of the motions to dismiss or we construe it as a denial of the motion to compel arbitration, the matter is effectively remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with section 2(a) of the Act.\n",
       "Ultimately, where we have concluded that the trial court did not rule on the issue of arbitrability, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n",
       "Dismissed.\n",
       "HARTMAN and GREIMAN, JJ, concur.\n",
       "1 Erroneously identified in the caption as Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc. JUSTICE LYTTON\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "Plaintiffs sued defendant, Illinois Power Company (Illinois Power), alleging that its negligent conduct caused them injury when their snowmobiles collided with support wires owned by Illinois Power. Illinois Power filed a motion to dismiss based on language in the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act (Act) (625 ILCS 40/1 (West 2000)), which provides that a landowner, lessee, or occupant is liable only for willful or malicious conduct. The trial court determined that Illinois Power was not an owner, lessee or occupant and denied the motion. Illinois Power sought leave to appeal under Rule 308 (155 Ill. 2d R. 308), which the trial court granted. We reverse and remand.\n",
       "FACTS\n",
       "Plaintiffs were snowmobiling through a field and struck a support wire, which anchored the top of a tall, wooden pole to the ground. The pole is one among a system of poles that carry electrical transmission lines across the countryside. Illinois Power owned the pole, the support wires and the electrical lines. The plaintiffs suffered injuries, and one of them subsequently died. The pole and lines were erected in 1948, and Illinois Power has maintained them ever since. Illinois Power is not an owner or lessee of the property on which the pole and fines existed.\n",
       "The plaintiffs sued Illinois Power alleging negligence.\n",
       "1\n",
       "Illinois Power filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it owed no duty to plaintiffs under the Act. The court denied the motion and granted leave to file this interlocutory appeal under Supreme Court Rule 308 (155 Ill. 2d R. 308).\n",
       "ANALYSIS\n",
       "Since this case involves the construction of a statute, our review is de novo. People ex rel. Birkett v. City of Chicago, 202 Ill. 2d 36, 46 (2002).\n",
       "The Act provides that snowmobilers have no action in negligence against owners, lessees, or occupants of property:\n",
       "“Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an owner, lessee, or occupant of premises owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for snowmobiling, or to give warning of any condition, use, structure or activity on such premises. *** Nothing in this section limits in any way liability which otherwise exists for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.” 625 ILCS 40/5 — 1(1) (West 2002).\n",
       "Since both parties in this case agree that Illinois Power is neither an owner nor a lessee, the issue is whether it is an “occupant.”\n",
       "Since the Act does not define “occupant,” we look to the statute to derive the best indication of the legislature’s intent, and we must ascribe ordinary meaning to the Act’s terms. In re Application for Judgment & Sale of Delinquent Properties for the Tax Year 1989, 167 Ill. 2d 161, 168 (1995). Where a statute’s language is clear and unambiguous, we apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms. Board of Education of Rockford School District No. 205 v. Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board, 165 Ill. 2d 80, 87 (1995).\n",
       "An occupant need not have ownership rights in the property. See In re Application for Tax Deed, 285 Ill. App. 3d 930 (1997) (analyzing the term “occupant” under the Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/ 22 — 10 (West 1994)) and finding that it does not require any ownership interest in the property). Black’s Law Dictionary defines occupant as “[o]ne who has possessory rights in, or control over, certain property or premises.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1106 (7th ed. 1999). We think this is a reasonable definition of an occupant under the statute. One who exercises control over property can be said to occupy it. Here, Illinois Power installed and owned the pole and wires and maintained them for 55 years. We believe these facts indicate a sufficient amount of control over the property to consider Illinois Power an occupant under the Act.\n",
       "Moreover, the Act illustrates our state’s policy to place the burden to protect snowmobilers on the snowmobilers themselves. Our supreme court has held that snowmobiles are inherently dangerous instrumentalities and that the legislature acted properly when it determined that no duty exists to keep premises safe for snowmobiling. Ostergren v. Forest Preserve District, 104 Ill. 2d 128 (1984).\n",
       "Illinois Power owed no duty to keep the premises safe for plaintiffs, absent willful or malicious conduct. The trial court erred by denying Illinois Power’s motion to dismiss.\n",
       "CONCLUSION\n",
       "The order of the circuit court of La Salle County is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings under the willful and malicious counts of the complaint.\n",
       "Reversed and remanded.\n",
       "SCHMIDT and SLATER, JJ., concur.\n",
       "1 Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to add counts alleging willful or malicious conduct. JUSTICE GREIMAN\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "Following a jury trial, the petitioner, Jesse Cortez, was convicted of one count of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder. On December 9, 1993, petitioner was sentenced to concurrent terms of 35 and 15 years.\n",
       "On June 15, 1998, petitioner filed a pro se postconviction petition. On February 9, 1999, the State filed a motion to dismiss the petition as untimely. Petitioner filed a response and supporting affidavit alleging that his petition was filed late because he was held in continuous segregation from April 3, 1994, through May 31, 1998. On October 12, 2000, the trial court granted the State’s motion to dismiss the petition on the basis that it was untimely and petitioner was not free of culpable negligence.\n",
       "The primary issue before us is whether the trial court properly dismissed petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief as untimely. If we find that the trial court erred in allowing the State to file and proceed with its motion to dismiss petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief past the statutory deadline, then we must determine the remedy, if any, to which petitioner is entitled.\n",
       "“The Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act [(Act)] provides a mechanism by which those under criminal sentence in this state can assert that their convictions were the result of a substantial denial of their rights under the United States Constitution or the Illinois Constitution or both.” People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366, 378-79 (1998); 725 ILCS 5/122 — 1 (West 1998). Pursuant to section 122 — 2.1 of the Act, the trial court has the authority to dismiss a petition if the petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment and if the court finds that the “ ‘petition is frivolous or is patently without merit.’ ” See Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 379, quoting 725 ILCS 5/122 — 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998), and citing People v. Brisbon, 164 Ill. 2d 236, 242-43 (1995). Under section 122 — 2.1, the State is not required to file any type of responsive pleading. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 379. The trial court must determine within 90 days of the filing of the petition if it is frivolous or patently without merit. People v. Ponyi, 315 Ill. App. 3d 568, 572-73 (2000).\n",
       "If a petition is not dismissed under section 122 — 2.1, then it moves to a second-stage proceeding under sections 122 — 4 through 122 — 6 of the Act. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366; 725 ILCS 5/122 — 2.1(b) (West 1998). “In such cases and in the cases of petitioners under sentence of death, section 122- — 5 directs that the State shall either answer or move to dismiss the petition.” Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 379. Where the issue is whether the allegations are sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing under the Act, the standard of review is that of plenary review. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 388-89.\n",
       "Section 122 — 1 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act provides the time frame for fifing a postconviction petition:\n",
       "“No proceedings under this Article shall be commenced more than 6 months after the denial of a petition for leave to appeal or the date for filing such a petition if none is filed or more than 45 days after the defendant files his or her brief in the appeal of the sentence before the Illinois Supreme Court (or more than 45 days after the deadline for the fifing of the defendant’s brief with the Illinois Supreme Court if no brief is filed) or 3 years from the date of conviction, whichever is sooner, unless the petitioner alleges facts showing that the delay was not due to his or her culpable negligence.” 725 ILCS 5/122 — 1(c) (West 1998).\n",
       "In the case at bar, final judgment was entered when petitioner was sentenced on December 9, 1993. The parties do not dispute that the applicable date for timely filing of petitioner’s petition was December 9, 1996, which was three years from December 9, 1993. Petitioner, however, did not mail his petition until June 1, 1998.\n",
       "The petition was file-stamped on June 15, 1998. On September 1, 1998, petitioner’s case was assigned to a trial court judge. When the case was called on September 1, 1998, the State advised the trial court it was planning to file a motion to dismiss, and the public defender’s office informed the court that it was not involved in petitioner’s case. At that point, the trial court appointed the public defender’s office to represent petitioner. On February 9, 1999, the State filed its motion to dismiss. On July 12, 2000, petitioner filed a response to the State’s motion to dismiss. In his response, petitioner alleged that he had been in segregation, first, at Menard Correctional Center from April 3, 1994, to May 31, 1996, then at Stateville Correctional Center from May 31, 1996, to June 2, 1997, and, lastly, at Pontiac Correction Center from June 2, 1997, to May 31, 1998. By way of affidavit, petitioner stated that while in segregation he had “sharply reduced access” to the law library and to a law clerk. On October 12, 2000, at the conclusion of a hearing on the State’s motion to dismiss, the trial court granted the State’s motion to dismiss, finding that petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief was not timely filed and that petitioner failed to show that the delay was not due to his culpable negligence.\n",
       "Pursuant to section 122 — 2.1(b) of the Act, if a petition is not summarily dismissed at the first stage, it advances to the second stage, where “the court shall order the petition to be docketed for further consideration in accordance with Sections 122 — 4 through 122 — 6.” 725 ILCS 5/122 — 2.1(b) (West 1998). According to section 122 — 5, the State must answer or move to dismiss a petition within 30 days after the entry of an order pursuant to section 122 — 2.1(b) or “within such further time as the court may set.” 725 ILCS 5/122 — 5 (West 1998).\n",
       "A review of the record reveals that the trial court never extended the time by which the State could file its motion to dismiss. Thus, the record clearly shows that the State filed its motion to dismiss beyond the time limit set forth in section 122 — 5.\n",
       "On appeal, petitioner contends that since the State filed its motion to dismiss approximately four months after the filing deadline, the trial court should have found that the State waived its opportunity, at the second stage, to object to the timeliness of his petition. Moreover, petitioner argues that pursuant to People v. Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d 876 (2001), the trial court should have found that he was not culpably negligent in filing his petition late. The State argues that since petitioner responded to the motion to dismiss and a hearing was held, petitioner was not prejudiced and, as a result, his argument is without merit.\n",
       "Presently, there are two narrow issues before us. First, we must determine what remedy is available to petitioner as a result of the State filing its motion to dismiss past the statutory filing deadline. More specifically, we must determine whether petitioner was automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing due to the fact that the State’s motion to dismiss was not timely. If we find that petitioner is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing, then we must determine whether the trial court’s decision to grant the State’s motion to dismiss, thereby finding that petitioner failed to show that he was not culpably negligent, was an abuse of discretion.\n",
       "In an effort to determine what remedy, if any, is available to petitioner as a result of the State filing its motion to dismiss past the statutory filing deadline, we turn first to the language of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act and find no guidance on this issue. The legislature, in drafting the Act, did not provide the petitioner with a specific remedy for such late filing. Consequently, we turn next to the Illinois Supreme Court for insight.\n",
       "In People v. Howell, 60 Ill. 2d 117, 119 (1975), the defendant was imprisoned for 65 days “without giving him a prompt preliminary hearing or presenting his case to a grand jury.” The Illinois Supreme Court held that the State violated section 7 of article I of the Illinois Constitution, which provides:\n",
       "“ ‘No person shall be held to answer for a crime punishable by death or by imprisonment in the penitentiary unless either the initial charge has been brought by *** indictment of a grand jury or the person has been given a prompt preliminary hearing to establish probable cause.’ ” Howell, 60 Ill. 2d at 119, quoting Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 7.\n",
       "The Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged that since the defendant did not receive a prompt preliminary hearing, the constitution had been violated and that “[t]he legislature has not fashioned a remedy of discharge for a violation of this section.” Howell, 60 Ill. 2d at 120.\n",
       "In Howell, the supreme court noted its decision in People v. Hendrix, 54 Ill. 2d 165, 169 (1973), where it specifically stated that “section 7 does not provide a grant of immunity from prosecution as a sanction for its violation.” Furthermore, the Hendrix court stated that it would not make sense to interpret section 7 as requiring the discharge and dismissal of the defendant and his case. Hendrix, 54 Ill. 2d at 169.\n",
       "Ultimately, the Howell court found that the nature of the remedy available to a defendant who did not receive a prompt preliminary hearing “is of little concern in the disposition of the present case.” Howell, 60 Ill. 2d at 120.\n",
       "In reviewing the language of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, as a whole, and noting the high standards that must be met by a petitioner seeking an evidentiary hearing, we find that the Act does not automatically grant an evidentiary hearing where the State failed to timely file its motion to dismiss.\n",
       "Our supreme court faced a similar issue in People v. Farnsley, 53 Ill. 2d 537 (1973), and without citation announced that disposition of defendant’s postconviction shall not be reversed “simply because the State may have delayed in filing its answer, especially, as here, where there is no indication that defendant was prejudiced by the delay.” Farnsley, 53 Ill. 2d at 548-49.\n",
       "Following Farnsley, the appellate court held in People v. Cartee, 86 Ill. App. 3d 895 (1980):\n",
       "“While the delay of the State to file a written answer to the petition was clearly a violation of the language of the statute, it is noted that no sanction is provided in the statute for failure by the State to make timely answer to the petition. The extreme penalty of vacating the conviction for failure to make timely answer seems inappropriate, although it is recognized that since the petition is filed with the objective of ending the defendant’s incarceration in prison, the question of delay is a material consideration. It should be noted, however, that the trial court granted extensions of time for answering the petition and such continuances are within the court’s discretion. In People v. Farnsley (1973), 53 Ill. 2d 537, the supreme court rejected the petitioner’s contention that an answer to a post-conviction hearing filed beyond the statutory time limit should not be considered since the statute is mandatory in requiring an answer to be filed within 30 days. In rejecting that contention, the supreme court said:\n",
       "‘He [the petitioner] does not cite, nor do we find, any authority for the proposition that a valid disposition of a post-conviction petition will be reversed simply because the State may have delayed in filing its answer, especially, as here, where there is no indication that defendant was prejudiced by the delay.’ 53 Ill. 2d 536, 548-49.” Cartee, 86 Ill. App. 3d at 899.\n",
       "The court further observed:\n",
       "“[T]he statute is not couched in mandatory language. *** [W]e will not take the extreme course of reversing a conviction because of such delay.” Cartee, 86 Ill. App. 3d at 899-900.\n",
       "Although section 122 — 5 provides that the State “shall answer or move to dismiss” within 30 days, a reading of section 122 — 5 in its entirety provides the court with the discretion necessary to decide this case upon the State’s tardy motion to dismiss:\n",
       "“The court may in its discretion make such order as to amendment of the petition or any other pleading, or as to pleading over, or filing further pleadings, or extending the time of filing any pleading other than the original petition, as shall be appropriate, just and reasonable and as is generally provided in civil cases.” 725 ILCS 5/122 — 5 (West 1998).\n",
       "It seems well settled that the court may exercise its discretion to allow the filing of tardy pleadings in civil cases. In that regard we note the clear holding in In re Custody of McCarthy, 157 Ill. App. 3d 377, 380-81 (1987):\n",
       "“We first address the issue of whether or not respondent waived his right to object to petitioners’ standing by failing to make a timely motion to dismiss. *** Section 2 — 619(a) provides that a motion to dismiss must be brought ‘within the time for pleading.’ (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 110, par. 2 — 619(a).) In the present case, respondent clearly did not file the motion to dismiss within the time for pleading. The motion was filed nine months after evidentiary hearings began. At that time, the court had heard testimony on 16 different days. Nevertheless, the trial court has the discretion to allow the withdrawal of an answer and the subsequent filing of a tardy motion to dismiss based on a defense not raised in the answer. (Midwest Bank & Trust Co. v. Village of Lakewood (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 962.) Unless it can be demonstrated that the opposing party was prejudiced by the late filing of the motion to dismiss, the trial court does not abuse its discretion by allowing tardy pleadings. Illinois Housing Development Authority v. Sjostrom & Sons, Inc. (1982), 105 Ill. App. 3d 247, 253.”\n",
       "We hold that where the State does not file its motion to dismiss a postconviction petition within the statutory filing deadline set forth in section 122 — 5, the petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless he can show that he suffered prejudice as a result of the State’s failure to file a timely motion to dismiss.\n",
       "As to such prejudice, the facts of the case at bar reveal that petitioner filed a response to the State’s motion to dismiss. Additionally, we note that petitioner’s response to the State’s motion to dismiss was not filed pro se, but rather petitioner was aided by legal counsel in the drafting and filing of his response brief. The record further indicates that a hearing was held on the State’s motion to dismiss. Since petitioner was given the opportunity to respond to the State’s motion to dismiss and a hearing was held, we find that petitioner has failed to show that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the State’s untimely filing and is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n",
       "We also do not condone the State’s failure to abide by the statutory guidelines. The trial court, pursuant to section 122 — 5, has the authority to set some further time limit and the State, in an effort to protect the integrity of the postconviction process, should have asked the trial court for an extension of time regarding the filing of its motion to dismiss.\n",
       "We now examine whether the trial court erred in granting the State’s motion to dismiss petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief. Specifically, we address whether the trial court properly found that petitioner failed to show that he lacked culpable negligence. An order granting the State’s motion to dismiss is a final judgment subject to de novo review. People v. Barrow, 195 Ill. 2d 506, 519 (2001).\n",
       "In People v. Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d 876, 885 (2001), the appellate court held:\n",
       "“[W]here a petitioner who has begun work on a postconviction petition is placed in segregation through no foreseeable fault of his own or otherwise prevented from filing his petition for a period of time until and including the last day of the period in which he may timely file, his failure to file in a timely manner is not culpable negligence.”\n",
       "The Scullark court qualified its holding by expressly stating that “where segregation is at issue, the petitioner must allege that his placement in segregation was through no fault of his own.” Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 888.\n",
       "In Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 886, the petitioner was placed in segregation on May 26, 1998, and his postconviction petition and other property were confiscated after he had begun working on his petition. The record showed that the petitioner remained in segregation until well after his petition was due. Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 886. The appellate court found that “[bjecause of his segregation status and because his property was taken from him, petitioner was not able to file his petition on any date after the date he was placed in segregation. Thus, the filing date for his petition was effectively moved forward to the day he was placed in segregation.” Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 886.\n",
       "The appellate court in Scullark expressly stated that it reached the issue of whether a petitioner’s segregation results in culpable negligence as an issue of first impression. Accordingly, the Scullark court found that “petitioner had no precedent on this issue to inform him of the necessity of alleging that he was not in segregation due to his own misconduct.” Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 888. Since the petitioner’s ignorance of the law was through no fault of his own, the appellate court remanded the matter in order to provide the petitioner an opportunity to amend his petition to so allege that he was not in segregation due to his own misconduct. Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 888.\n",
       "In the case at bar, petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief was mailed on June 1, 1998, and petitioner’s response to the State’s motion to dismiss was filed on July 12, 2000. Scullark was decided by this court on March 13, 2001; thus, petitioner had no knowledge of the pleading requirements set forth in Scullark when he alleged that he was free of culpable negligence due to the fact that he was held in continuous segregation. Like the court in Scullark, we take petitioner’s ignorance of the law, which was obviously through no fault of his own, into consideration in determining whether the trial court erred in finding that petitioner was not free of culpable negligence.\n",
       "The parties do not dispute that petitioner’s petition was due no later than December 9, 1996, but was not filed until June of 1998. In his petition, petitioner fails to allege any reason explaining why his petition was filed untimely. The issue of untimeliness is not mentioned in the petition. Not until the filing of his response to the State’s motion to dismiss does petitioner allege that his petition was not timely filed due to the fact that he was in segregation and, consequently, had limited access to the law library. Attached to petitioner’s response brief is an affidavit in which petitioner asserts that he did not learn of the statutory filing deadline for a postconviction petition until 1997, long after the filing deadline for his own petition. In his affidavit, petitioner asserts that his petition was filed untimely due to the fact that he was in segregation and, thus, had reduced access to the law library and a law clerk. Without the access to the law library and the aid of a law clerk, petitioner asserts, by way of his affidavit, that he had no way of filing a postconviction petition. A careful reading of petitioner’s affidavit reveals that petitioner does not allege that he had no access to the law library; rather, petitioner asserts that during the time he was in segregation he had “sharply reduced access to the law library.”\n",
       "After reviewing petitioner’s response brief and hearing arguments, the trial court dismissed petitioner’s petition on the basis of untimeliness, finding that petitioner failed to show that he lacked culpable negligence. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the trial court’s decision to dismiss petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief.\n",
       "We first note that there is a significant factual distinction between the case at bar and Scullark. In Scullark, the defendant had already begun work on his petition before it was confiscated from him, while in the instant case, petitioner did not begin to prepare his petition until long after the due date for filing had passed. That fact that the defendant in Scullark had already started his petition before the prison went into lockdown was crucial to the court’s holding. The Scullark court explained:\n",
       "“To hold otherwise would mean, for example, that a petitioner who completed a petition even several months before it was due and was placed in segregation immediately after finishing the petition but before he was able to file it and remained unable to file it until after the deadline, would be culpably negligent.” Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 885.\n",
       "In the case at bar, it is significant that the petitioner did not begin work on his petition until long after the date it was due to be filed. As such, the aforementioned concerns of the Scullark court are not applicable in this case.\n",
       "Next, we address petitioner’s contention that he lacks culpable negligence as a result of being held in continuous segregation. We begin by reviewing the record for an indication of whether petitioner was placed in segregation as a result of his own misconduct. Petitioner’s response to the State’s motion to dismiss includes computer printouts from the Illinois Department of Corrections which indicate that on numerous occasions petitioner was placed in segregation for long periods of time. These computer printouts farther reveal that petitioner’s placement in segregation was indeed due to his own misconduct, as his record is replete with disciplinary violations. For instance, petitioner was placed in “disciplinary segregation, lockup” on at least three separate occasions. Furthermore, he was listed as a participant in the assault of a staff member on at least two occasions. Under these circumstances, petitioner’s culpability is undeniable. As the Scullark court explained:\n",
       "“[E]ngaging in intentional misconduct which would, with reasonably foreseeable certainty, result in prison action that would prevent one from filing in a timely manner would in all likelihood fall within the definition of culpable negligence as ‘negligence of a gross and flagrant character.’ ” Scullark, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 887-88.\n",
       "Thus, it would be senseless to remand this matter so as to afford petitioner the opportunity to allege that he was in segregation through no fault of his own behavior because the computer printouts that he offered into evidence render such an argument moot.\n",
       "Next, we address petitioner’s allegation that he had “sharply reduced access” to the law library. While he does not elaborate on the extent of his access, he implies that he retained at least partial access to the library. This court has held that while the total denial of access to the prison law library during a lockdown may sometimes excuse a late filing, a petitioner who has some access to the library during the period in which he must file fails to show that he lacked culpable negligence in failing to timely file his petition based solely on the evidence of the lockdown. In that instance, the petitioner must also show that he was deprived of a “meaningful opportunity” to prepare the petition. See People v. Mitchell, 296 Ill. App. 3d 930 (1998); People v. Van Hee, 305 Ill. App. 3d 333 (1999). In Mitchell, the defendant alleged that his delay in filing a postconviction petition was not due to his culpable negligence because the prison in which he was incarcerated was on lockdown for part of the time period in which he was to file his petition. The majority in Mitchell, agreeing with Justice Green’s dissent in People v. McClain, 292 Ill. App. 3d 185 (1997), explained that “where the record shows that lockdowns have deprived the defendant of a meaningful opportunity to prepare his petition in a timely fashion, we believe some delay is excusable.” Mitchell, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 933. However, the Mitchell court found that the defendant failed to allege sufficient facts to meet his burden of showing that he was deprived of the meaningful opportunity to prepare his petition in a timely fashion where the prison was sporadically, but not continuously, in lockdown during the relevant time period. Mitchell, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 934. In People v. Van Hee, 305 Ill. App. 3d 333, 337 (1999), the court found that the defendant had failed to include the specific dates of the prison’s lockdown and that, absent such information, it would deem the lockdown as having been short in duration. Consequently, thé court determined that the lockdown did not excuse the defendant’s delay because he had access to the library during the time the lockdown was not in effect and, therefore, was not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to prepare his petition. Van Hee, 305 Ill. App. 3d at 337. Similarly, in the case at bar, we find that petitioner had some access to the library and that his segregation did not deprive him of a meaningful opportunity to prepare his petition in a timely fashion. Therefore, even if the petitioner’s segregation had not been the result of his own misconduct, he would still be culpably negligent under the above-discussed circumstances.\n",
       "For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court’s dismissal of petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief.\n",
       "Affirmed.\n",
       "THEIS, EJ., and KARNEZIS, J., concur. PRESIDING JUSTICE McBRIDE\n",
       "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
       "Plaintiff Brian G. Nichols, a Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) employee, requested a withdrawal of his funds from the CTA Employees’ Deferred Compensation Plan (Plan). Nichols’ applications were denied by the committee (Committee) that administers the Plan and he appealed to the circuit court. The circuit court found that the Committee did not abuse its discretion in denying Nichols’ request for funds. Nichols appeals to this court, pro se, contending that the Committee erred in failing to acknowledge his status as an eligible participant for the Plan’s emergency hardship withdrawal.\n",
       "At the time of the hearing, Nichols had been employed as a bus operator with the CTA for over 20 years. He participated in the Plan from 1987 or 1988 through January 1999. Nichols testified that in addition to his employment with the CTA, he held a second job with the Beverly Bus Federal Credit Union as an assistant treasurer. Nichols held this job with the credit union starting in 1990. He was not rehired by the credit union in March of 1999. Nichols testified that his termination by the credit union caught him by surprise as he expected to be employed with it until he eventually became the treasurer. At the time his employment from the credit union was terminated, Nichols’ monthly net salary with the credit union was approximately $1,100.\n",
       "Nichols’ first application to withdraw funds from the Plan was February 17, 1999. Nichols characterized the loss of his second job with the credit union as an “unforeseeable emergency.” This application was denied by the Committee on February 24, 1999. The Committee noted that “[n]o specific event which was extraordinary, unforeseeable and beyond the control of the Participant was identified.” Nichols appealed the denial of his application. On March 30, 1999, his appeal to the Committee was denied on the basis that his application failed to identify a “correct hardship reason.” Nichols made additional application for distribution of funds on June 23, 1999, and August 24, 1999. Both additional applications were subsequently denied.\n",
       "The CTA’s Employees’ Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to qualify as an eligible “State Deferred Compensation Plan” under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 26 U.S.C. § 457(b) (2000). The purpose of the Plan is to provide an optional benefit to CTA employees whereby a designated.amount of the participant’s compensation is withheld each month by the employer and placed into a trust. The employee may withdraw funds from the Plan in the event of an “unforeseeable emergency.” Under section 5.12 of the Plan:\n",
       "“a distribution of Deferred Compensation credited to a Participant’s account shall be permitted in the event the Participant experiences an unforeseeable emergency, determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, creating severe financial hardship as a result of sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or of a dependent of the Participant (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code), loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. Payment may not be made to the extent that such hardship is or may be relieved: (1) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise; (2) by liquidation of the Participant’s assets to the extent the liquidation of those assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship; or (3) by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. The need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a new home shall not be considered unforeseeable emergencies. All distributions under this subparagraph shall be in a lump sum and shall be permitted only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need, taking into account the amount of any income tax withholding or other income tax liability resulting from the distribution. Application for distributions under this subparagraph must be approved by the Committee. The Committee shall have authority to require such evidence as it may need to determine whether a Participant is experiencing an unforeseeable emergency.”\n",
       "Under the Administrative Review Law, we review the final decision of the administrative agency and not the decision of the circuit court. 735 ILCS 5/3 — 101 et seq. (West 2000). When deciding a mixed question of law and fact, we review the agency’s decision under a clearly erroneous standard. City of Belvidere v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 181 Ill. 2d 191, 205, 692 N.E.2d 295 (1998). As articulated by the Illinois Supreme Court: “because this case involves an examination of the legal effect of a given set of facts, it involves a mixed question of fact and law. Given the mixed nature of the [Committee’s] decision, we find that the applicable standard of review should be between a manifest weight of the evidence standard and a de novo standard so as to provide some deference to the [Committee’s] experience and expertise. We therefore hold that a clearly erroneous standard of review is appropriate to examine the [Committee’s] decision.” City of Belvidere, 181 Ill. 2d at 205.\n",
       "It is undisputed that Nichols’ alleged severe financial hardship was not the result of a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of Nichols or of a dependent, or loss of his property due to casualty. Nichols argues that his severe financial hardship due to the loss of his second job with the Beverly Bus Federal Credit Union falls under the category of “other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond [his] control.” The Plan specifically states that sending a child to college or buying a new home is not an expense that qualifies as an “unforeseeable emergenc[y].” Except for these two specific examples, the Plan does not delineate what would or would not qualify as “unforeseeable emergencies.” Likewise, the Plan does not provide examples of “other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances.” Schmitt v. Review Committee (The Copeland Cos.), 179 A.D.2d 959, 960, 579 N.Y.S.2d 217, 218 (1992), noted that by operation of the rule of ejusdem generis, the language of “ ‘other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances’ is limited in its effect by the specific examples preceding it.”\n",
       "The Plan does state that the distribution of funds from the participant’s account is determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Courts have noted that the language “sole discretion” does not command complete judicial deference. Cutting v. Jerome Foods, Inc., 993 F.2d 1293, 1296 (7th Cir. 1993). However, it has been held that the language “sole discretion” is an “unambiguous vesting of discretion” requiring the rejection of the contention that the language is “uncertain and ambiguous.” Quinn v. Non-Contributory National Long Term Disability Program, 113 F. Supp. 2d 1216, 1221 (N.D. Ill. 2000). See also Gatto v. St. Richard School, Inc., 774 N.E.2d 914 (Ind. App. 2002); Hackett v. Xerox Corp. Long-Term Disability Income Plan, 117 F. Supp. 2d 803 (N.D. Ill. 2001). While we do not give the Committee unfettered discretion on appellate review, we do appreciate the importance of the Plan’s meaning and intent. We find that discretion is vested in the Committee to make determinations for distribution under the Plan, and we review the Committee’s decision with an eye toward deference to its unique experience.\n",
       "When Nichols’ application for distribution was denied on March 30, 1999, the Committee stated that “the determination was that there is no correct hardship reason identified.” When his application was denied on June 30, 1999, the Committee’s reason was that “no specific event which was extraordinary, unforeseeable and beyond the control of the participant was identified.” On September 29, 1999, Nichols’ application was denied for the same reason as noted on the June 30, 1999, letter from the Committee.\n",
       "At the hearing, Nichols testified that from 1990 to 1999 he was reappointed each year as the assistant treasurer of the credit union. In 1999, the treasurer of the credit union did not reappoint Nichols as the assistant treasurer. Nichols argues in his brief that there was nothing to indicate that his second job with the credit union was “threatened, or even remotely, expected to be eliminated, and it was an unforeseen event.” He argues he was not concerned about his job security with the credit union because he was the only professional person with the organization.\n",
       "1\n",
       "Nichols believed his job was secure with the credit union because the treasurer of the credit union was a close friend and Nichols was assured by the treasurer that he (Nichols) would be the next treasurer of the organization upon his friend’s retirement. Nichols contends that, under these circumstances, the loss of this second job was “unforeseeable.” In its brief, the CTA contends that the loss of a second job is not an unforeseeable emergency for purposes of the Plan because “it is neither something that a reasonable person would find extraordinary, nor something that is so unusual that it cannot be foreseen.” In its September 23, 1999, denial of Nichols’ application, the Committee noted: “second job is contractual with option of replacement every year. Not unforeseeable.” We agree with the Committee. By his own testimony, Nichols stated that his position with the credit union was contractual in the sense that he had to be reappointed each year in order to maintain his position. Despite the fact that Nichols was reappointed as assistant treasurer by his friend each year for nine years, it was foreseeable that a year would come where Nichols would not be reappointed. We do not find under the circumstances presented in this case that the loss of Nichols’ second job would qualify as an “extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstance” under the Plan.\n",
       "Nichols testified that he suffered from severe financial hardship due to the loss of his second job. At the time of trial — October 16, 2001 — Nichols stated that his home was in foreclosure due to nonpayment of the mortgage, his automobile was in the process of being repossessed because his payment was three months in arrears, he was “subject to” a wage garnishment because of a nonpayment of debt owed to the credit union, and his credit was “destroyed” due to late or no payments on credit cards. He also testified that his home was in a state of disrepair and in need of new windows. The amount of Nichols’ indebtedness, exclusive of his home, at the time of trial was estimated by Nichols to be $50,000. On cross-examination, Nichols testified that at the time he filed his first application for withdrawal of funds from the Plan, his monthly mortgage payment was $580 and his monthly automobile payment was $535. He also testified that his annual salary with the CTA was approximately $40,000. Significantly, Nichols testified that in February of 2001, he began working a new second job with Federal Express. He testified that he netted approximately $900 a month from this new second job — approximately $200 less than what he was making with the credit union. See Shorter v. Leach, 277 N.J. Super. 617, 650 A.2d 16 (1994) (automobile accident victim’s claim of economic loss did not raise issue necessary to demonstrate that she suffered a “serious impact” on her lifestyle).\n",
       "The Plan states that payment of funds will not be made if the hardship may be relieved through “reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise.” The Plan also provides that payments may not be made to the extent that the hardship is or may be relieved “by liquidation of the Participant’s assets to the extent the liquidation of those assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship.” By his own testimony, Nichols has made significant efforts to relieve his hardship by seeking and obtaining a new second job. While we acknowledge that a period of time elapsed between the loss of his employment with the credit union and his employment with Federal Express, we cannot ignore that Nichols’ “severe financial hardship” was being relieved through a new avenue of compensation. Additionally, the Plan suggests that withdrawals may not be allowed where liquidation of assets may relieve the hardship. At the hearing, Nichols testified to potential assets in the form of a house and automobile.\n",
       "Both parties stated at the hearing and in their briefs that the courts have not provided any guidance as to whether the loss of a second job should be considered an unforeseeable emergency. Our research has proven equally fruitless. We do find some guidance from the New York appellate court. In Schmitt v. Review Committee (The Copeland Cos.), Schmitt requested a withdrawal of funds from his employer’s deferred compensation fund. He alleged an “unforeseeable emergency” due to his delinquent federal income taxes for 1987, 1988 and 1989. Schmitt’s employer denied his request based on a determination that his circumstances did not qualify as an “unforeseen financial hardship” under Internal Revenue Code section 457. The New York trial court found that financial mismanagement could be considered an unforeseeable emergency and granted judgment in favor of Schmitt. The employer then appealed to the New York appellate court. Schmitt, 179 A.D.2d at 959, 579 N.Y.S.2d at 218. In its opinion, the appellate court noted that, under the IRS statute, an unforeseeable emergency “require[s] a showing of ‘severe financial hardship’ resulting from a ‘sudden and unexpected illness or accident’, property loss due to casualty or ‘other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant.’ ” Schmitt, 179 A.D.2d at 960, 579 N.Y.S.2d at 218, quoting 26 C.F.R. § 1.457 — 2(h)(4) (1992). Under the language provided by the statute, the appellate court found that delinquent federal income taxes did not justify a premature withdrawal of Schmitt’s investment. The court stated: “[T]he language must be confined to matters such as unexpected illnesses, accidents or other extraordinary circumstances and cannot be construed so broadly as to include unanticipated financial shortages as the result of poor money management.” Schmitt, 179 A.D.2d at 960, 579 N.Y.S.2d at 218. Moreover, the court held that its review was “limited to ensuring that [the employer’s] determination was neither irrational nor unreasonable.” Schmitt, 179 A.D.2d at 960, 579 N.Y.S.2d at 218.\n",
       "We find under the circumstances presented at the hearing that Nichols’ loss of his second job with the Beverly Bus Federal Credit Union was not an unforeseeable emergency. We cannot say that the Committee was clearly erroneous in its decision to deny Nichols a withdrawal of funds. Therefore, we agree with the decision of the CTA’s unforeseeable emergency committee under the deferred compensation plan and affirm the decision of the trial court.\n",
